# To - Do App
Live Demo: https://martin-tercero1.github.io/curso-react-intro/

This web app was created using the Intro to React course by Platzi - [Curso de Introducci√≥n a React.js](https://platzi.com/reactjs).

The design was implemented from the following Figma: https://www.figma.com/file/XbtVcX9nTkHlumvPgsI4xl/To-do-List-%5BShort-Project%5D-(Community)?type=design&node-id=142%3A824&mode=design&t=PpmhljzeZn4KNXIK-1

Some of the concepts learned during this course were:
- useContext hook to avoid prop drilling
- Feature-First directories to have an orgnized structure
- useState to store data related to an specific component
- Handling events like onChange, onClick and onSubmit.

## Future changes
- Update styles for the add form
- Fix the persistency feature

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
